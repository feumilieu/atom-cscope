# atom-cscope-stack package

This is a fork of the fabulous [`atom-cscope`](https://github.com/amitab/atom-cscope) v0.14.1 package.
Its author did not like to merge my patch so I created this package.
It adds a stack of remembered positions to/from which user jumped with cscope.
It resembles the functionality of the Sublime Editor's
[`CscopeSublime`](https://github.com/ameyp/CscopeSublime) plugin that I find very useful.
Also I changed the default keybinding for this package to what I think is good to walking through a big project.
